# Geometric Deep Learning notes

These are personal notes on everything about GDL, from Graph Theory to GCN; they're part of my curricular internship program at University of Bologna and should be the ones leading to my bachelor thesis. Most of these are summaries/smaller copy-paste versions of papers/articles, with direct citations and links. 

To explore such topics and to experiment with implementing graph-based-learning NNs is my main focus, while providing all the resources from whom I've studied. By doing this I'm trying to define a simple and clear roadmap for anyone approaching GDL. 

There will also be a number of jupyter notebooks: the examples are taken from these very useful [PyTorch introductory articles from IAML](https://iaml.it/blog/fun-with-pytorch-part-1) (which are also available in [italian](https://iaml.it/blog/alle-prese-con-pytorch-parte-1)) which helped kickstart my skills in PyTorch.
